I wanted a slideshow I could display at my daughters wedding that allowed users to upload their own photos and they would automatically appear in the slideshow. 
Knocked this out in a weekend using Streamlit (I was going for rapid implemetation so cut me some slack). Throwing it up here so anyone can use it, there is a lot
of vibe coding in here too so cut me some slack there as well. Still working on getting some ENV level customizations so it can be more flexible, eventually I will
get it containerized so you could run it in docker. Currently you will have to deploy it on a box with python and streamlit, probably also pip install some packages.
